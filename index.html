                    <h3>Brandbook for Visual Communication Assignment</h3>
                    <p>For this project I had to make a brandbook for a company of my choice, style board and a process
                        portfolio to
                        reflect the work done. I had to use inDesign in order to create appealing product for potential
                        customers or partners
                        of the company. The goal was to preserve the brand image and create something luxurious to hold
                        which gives the feeling of
                        interaction with the brand's products</p>

                    <h3>Research for design - User trailing</h3>
                    <p>For Research for Design, we researched the user experience of using the Rijksstudio website.
                        Our aim was to uncover potential usability issues.
                        First, we researched the website itself and mapped its structure, functions and potential
                        usability problems. From those, we constructed our research questions. We decided to keep a
                        focus on the Rijksstudio part of the website and specifically to have the users work towards
                        creating a personalised route from their favourite works of art.
                        To test that, we constructed four tasks, each building on the next. Each task focussed on a
                        specific function of the website: general navigation, artwork pages, user generated sets and
                        finally personalised routes. We conducted a user trial with five users of various ages. They
                        were
                        tasked with performing the four tasks. During the user trail, they were filmed and their screen
                        recorded. Following that, we interviewed them to hone in on the specific issues they
                        encountered.
                        While our users liked the concept of the website, they encountered a number of usability issues.
                        Mainly, the tour functionality was so complicated none of them got it to work without our help.
                        Finally, we made some recommendations to improve the user experience, including changing
                        the back button behaviour, tweaks to iconography and streamlines the creation of personalised
                        routes.</p>

                    <p>This project was about coming up and presenting 3 concepts for making interantional students'
                        lives easier. Me and my team had to do research and FGI [Focus Group Interviews] in order to
                        come up with possible solutions to the already existing problems in the international students
                        society in the Netherlands. Concept book had to be created which I took as my responsibility
                        because I wanted to be able to present a concept book which speaks to our client that we are the
                        right team. We achieved success and were invited for secondary interview by I*ESN but un
                        fortunately we weren't chosen for the funding stage.</p>

                            the first things that I learned in the UXD course is that I am not the client neither the
                            user, that's why we designers use many research tools. </p>
